# mcpatl
Collection of implementation of algorithms and data structures for efficiency and speed in programming contests. 
Acronym is mc (from mc145)'s cp atlas. 

Note that this isn't cheating as platforms like Codeforces and Atcoder permit code that was written before the contest began. 

#Inspiration
A lot of this has been inspired by SecondThread and Ecnerwala as they use they're own libraries rather often. I also aspire that many other people perhaps use this or make their own version, as it really helps with implementation speed. 

#Tutorial
In the future, once this is further developed, I will probably be creating some short paper/handout to explain how to utilize this as well as explaining some data structures and algorithms. 

#Future Plans
To help with contests such as ioi, Facebook HackerCup, or any contest that requires stress-testing, I will add running files for regular code, interactive problems, comparing to brute force, generating test data, etc. 

#Further Information
My github page also includes many of the problems I've upsolved, as well as my code from live contests. It also contains the javascript files I use to create folders for my contests.
